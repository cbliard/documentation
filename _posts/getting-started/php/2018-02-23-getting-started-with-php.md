This tutorial will help you deploying a Go application in a few minutes. We will
also guide you through the different features Scalingo offers.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you:

- created a [Scalingo account](https://scalingo.com/users/signup)
- followed the [First Steps]({% post_url getting-started/2015-06-02-first-steps
%}) guide to setup Git and SSH
- installed the [command line interface tool]({% post_url
cli/2015-09-18-command-line-tool %})

## Deploy an Application

### Prepare the Application Code

Let's start by getting an sample application code. First clone the repository of
the sample:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Scalingo/sample-php-base.git
$ cd sample-php-base
```

You now have locally a functional Git repository that contains a simple PHP
application. Note the presence of a `composer.json` file at the root of the
project. Scalingo uses Composer for dependency management in PHP application.
The `composer.json` file also indicates to Scalingo that your application is
written in PHP.

The rest of the tutorial assumes that you are located in this `sample-php-base`
folder.

### Deploy the Application

In this step we will deploy the application on Scalingo to get it up and
running.

Create the app on Scalingo with:

```bash
$ scalingo create my-app
App 'my-app' has been created
Git repository detected: remote scalingo added
â†’ 'git push scalingo master' to deploy your app
```

When you create an app, a Git remote (called `scalingo`) is also created and
associated with your local Git repository.

Deploy the application with:

```bash
$ git push scalingo master

Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (9/9), done.
Writing objects: 100% (13/13), 1.29 KiB | 1.29 MiB/s, done.

The application is now available online at [https://my-app.scalingo.io](https://my-app.scalingo.io).

## Logs

Your application generates logs readable with:

```text

```

Access the application once using a web browser and you will get a new line of
logs:

```
2018-02-23 16:47:52.536015907 +0100 CET [web-1] 90.63.216.93 - "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 24989 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:58.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/58.0"
```

## Scale

By default, the application runs on a single container.

You can check the number of containers running your application with:

```bash
$ scalingo ps
+------+--------+------+---------+
| NAME | AMOUNT | SIZE | COMMAND |
+------+--------+------+---------+
| web  | 1      | M    | -       |
+------+--------+------+---------+
```

If redundancy is important or if a high traffic is expected, scale the
application to use more containers. For instance, scale the application to use
three containers with:

```bash
$ scalingo scale web:3
Your application is being scaled to:
  web: 3 - M
Status: Done in 8.177 seconds
Your application has been scaled.
```

You can also check the application usage to better understand whether it is
important to scale or not with:

```
$ scalingo stats
+-------+-----+-----------------+----------------+
| NAME  | CPU |     MEMORY      |      SWAP      |
+-------+-----+-----------------+----------------+
| web-1 | 0%  | 4%  24MB/512MB  | 0%   0B/512MB  |
|       |     | Highest:  25MB  | Highest:   0B  |
|       |     |                 |                |
| web-2 | 0%  | 4%  24MB/512MB  | 0%   0B/512MB  |
|       |     | Highest:  25MB  | Highest:   0B  |
|       |     |                 |                |
| web-3 | 0%  | 4%  24MB/512MB  | 0%   0B/512MB  |
|       |     | Highest:  24MB  | Highest:   0B  |
+-------+-----+-----------------+----------------+
```

## Deploy Modification of an App

In this step, we will see how to modify an application, and reflect your local
modification on the Scalingo application. We will add a dependency to
[Cowsay](https://github.com/alrik11es/cowsayphp), and modify the application to
use it.

First add the dependency with:

```bash
$ composer require alrik11es/cowsayphp
Using version ^1.2 for alrik11es/cowsayphp
./composer.json has been updated
Loading composer repositories with package information
Updating dependencies (including require-dev)
Package operations: 1 install, 0 updates, 0 removals
  - Installing alrik11es/cowsayphp (1.2.0): Downloading (100%)
Writing lock file
Generating autoload files
```

And replace the content of `index.php` to use this library:

```php
<?php
require_once __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

use Cowsayphp\Farm;
$whale = Farm::create(\Cowsayphp\Farm\Whale::class);
echo '<pre>'.$whale->say("Hi there!").'</pre>';
```

Commit your changes with:

```bash
$ git commit --all --message "Add Cowsay"
```

Now deploy to Scalingo, just as you did previously:

```bash
$ git push scalingo master
```
